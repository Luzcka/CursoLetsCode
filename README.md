### Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates:
### Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Records  

> "Abstract
> 
> Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients has a significant bearing on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. However, there are 
> few national assessments of diabetes care during hospitalization which could serve as a baseline for change. This analysis of a large clinical database
> (74 million unique encounters corresponding to 17 million unique patients) was undertaken to provide such an assessment and to find future directions
> which might lead to improvements in patient safety. Almost 70,000 inpatient diabetes encounters were identified with sufficient detail for analysis.
> Multivariable logistic regression was used to fit the relationship between the measurement of HbA1c and early readmission while controlling for
> covariates such as demographics, severity and type of the disease, and type of admission. Results show that the measurement of HbA1c was performed
> infrequently (18.4%) in the inpatient setting. The statistical model suggests that the relationship between the probability of readmission and the
> HbA1c measurement depends on the primary diagnosis. The data suggest further that the greater attention to diabetes reflected in HbA1c determination
> may improve patient outcomes and lower cost of inpatient care."
